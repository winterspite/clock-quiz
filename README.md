# clock-quiz

What is this? It's a basic Go app to learn fyne and to teach my daughter to calculate the difference
in hours and minutes between two analog clocks. 

## To Do List

- fix layout to look nicer
- scoreboard
- refresh / new challenge feature
    - clocks don't update
 
## Fix macOS quarantine?

`sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine MyApp.app`
