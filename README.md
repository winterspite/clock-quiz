# clock-quiz

What is this? It's a basic Go app to learn fyne and to teach my daughter to calculate the difference
in hours and minutes between two analog clocks. 

## To Do List

- fix layout to look nicer
- scoreboard
- refresh / new challenge feature
    - clocks don't update
- fix times again so we don't wrap over the day
- allow 12 when time is 00
 
## Fix macOS quarantine?

`sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine MyApp.app`
